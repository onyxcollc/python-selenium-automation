## 🧪 Python-Selenium-Automation – BDD UI Test Framework

This project was one of my **first hands-on experiences with automation**, 
where I learned core skills in test design, Selenium WebDriver, and maintainable test architecture.
It reflects both foundational learning and practical implementation of real-world QA practices.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Developed a **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** test automation framework using:

- 🐍 **Python**
- 🌿 **Behave**
- 🧩 **Page Object Model (POM)**
- 🧠 **Selenium WebDriver**

The framework focused on **end-to-end UI testing of real-world user flows on [Target.com](https://www.target.com/)**.  
It simulates login interactions, add to cart simulations, verification of products, switching to new windows,
error handling, and user-driven navigation to validate critical functionality.

## ✅ What I Built

- 🔹 A full-featured **BDD test suite** using Gherkin `.feature` files  
- 🔹 Automated **login scenarios** for both valid and invalid credentials on Target.com  
- 🔹 Structured test layers using **modular Page Object classes**  
- 🔹 Reusable, scalable **step definitions**  
- 🔹 Automated browser execution with **Selenium WebDriver**

## 📚 What I Learned

- ✅ Writing clean, maintainable automation code  
- ✅ Structuring BDD scenarios with **Gherkin syntax**  
- ✅ Creating flexible Page Objects to reduce duplication  
- ✅ Handling browser actions, waits, and element locators  
- ✅ Building real-world test frameworks from the ground up

📌 Final Thoughts
This project was an important foundation in my test automation journey.
It gave me hands-on experience building a scalable framework from scratch, 
and taught me how to approach automation in a way that mirrors real QA 
practices in a production like environment with Target.com as the system under test.
